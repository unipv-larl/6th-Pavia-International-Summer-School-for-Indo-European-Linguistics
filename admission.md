# Admission

We invite PhD students, as well as Postdocs and other young researchers. Advanced MA students will also be considered for admission, based on a written statement of their motivation for attending the school. As all courses will be taught in English, a good knowledge of English is a basic requirement. 

## Applications

If you are an undergraduate, or have not yet finished your MA, please send a letter of motivation to chiara.zanchi@unipv.it.
